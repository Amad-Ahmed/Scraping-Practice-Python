# SCRAPING PRACTICE IN PYTHON

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that I have written to practice web scraping. The scripts are written in Python 3 and use the BeautifulSoup and requests libraries. The website being scraped is remoteok.io, a job board for remote jobs.

The scraping practice has been broken down into multiple tasks where the difficulty level increases with each task.

## Task 1

The first task was to simply scrape the job title, company name, location, salary and tags for each job listing on the website. The data was then saved to a CSV file.

## Task 2

The second task is to scrape all the job listings for the Search filter drop down options. The data is saved to multiple CSV files, one for each search filter option.
